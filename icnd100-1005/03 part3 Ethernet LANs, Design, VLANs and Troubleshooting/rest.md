# Rest
******
Rest drivers
    - Heterogenous interoperability
    - Devices
    - Cloud
    
Rest is based on a network-based API rather than a library-based API.
Cloud -> Elastic infractructure {computing capability & storage capacity}
Build a scalable architecture in order to take advantage of a scalabe infrastructure

Appropriate software architectures guidelines:
    - Design a system that does not depend on complicated middleware that requires constant
    configuration changes and management overhead.
    - Design a system with transparency in mind so that failure conditions which despite the best 
    architecture, will still happen but can be quickly diagnosed and corrected.
    
# Architectural properties of REST
****************************
1. Heterogeny - seemless interoperation of apps regardless of languag or platform.

2. Scalability - reducing complexity btwn components in a distributed system / efficient
requests management hence horizontal scaling.

3.  Evolvability - independent evolution of Restful services and components

4. Visibility - allow monitoring operations and intelligent gateways to operate correctly
without needing access to proprietary or potentially hidden states. eg session state

5. Reliability - recovering from partial failures and development of rich compensation strategies
for those cases.

6. Efficiency - handling of requests  by intermediaries such as proxy servers and caches: load balancing.

7. Perfomance - speed of delivery.

8. Manageability - because of consistent and visibile interactions btwn components.

"Representational state transfer is meant to evoke an image of how a well-designed application"
behaves as a virtual state machine of web pages where progress is made via links" Roy Fielding.


# Richardson's maturity model
***********************

Level 0: POX
Level 1: Resources
Level 2: HTTP Verbs
Level 3: Hypermedia

Only level 3 in this model can be considered REST
