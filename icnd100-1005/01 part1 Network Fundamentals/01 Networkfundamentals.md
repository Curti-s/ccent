- Chapter 1
******************
	Covers the following exam topics:
		* 1.0 Network Fundamentals
		* 1.1 Compare and Contrast OSi and TCP/IP models
		* 1.2 Compare and contrast TCP and UDP protocols
		
	Starts with a discussion of networking models, whic give you the big picture view of the networking rules.
	
	Think of networking models as architectural plans for building a house. Networking model defines the rules abt how each part of the network should work as well as how parts should work together.
